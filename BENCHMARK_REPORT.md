# DME Performance Benchmark & Cross-Language Analysis Report
**Project:** Dynamic Modular Sieve (DME)
**Scale:** 10^15 (One Katrillion)
**Focus:** Deterministic Prime Detection Efficiency

## 1. Executive Summary
This report documents the performance transition of the Dynamic Modular Sieve (DME) algorithm from high-level interpreted Python to low-level compiled C and Rust. The objective was to validate the scalability of the **Direct Offset** formula across different computational stacks.

## 2. Test Environment
- **CPU:** Intel Celeron N2930 @ 1.83GHz (Legacy Hardware Testing)
- **Target Range:** [10^15, 10^15 + 10,000]
- **Methodology:** Deterministic Zero-Column Elimination (6n ± 1 Hexagonal Filter)

## 3. Comparative Performance Metrics

| Implementation | Execution Time | Efficiency Gain | Accuracy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Python (Original)** | 5.010 sec | 1.0x (Baseline) | %100.00 |
| **Rust (Core)** | 1.073 sec | 4.6x Faster | %100.00 |
| **C (GCC -O3)** | **0.937 sec** | **5.3x Faster** | **%100.00** |



## 4. Deterministic Data Consistency
Across all three languages, the DME engine produced identical results, confirming the mathematical stability of the methodology:
- **Total Elimination Commands:** 31,181
- **Unique Coordinates Deleted:** 9,737
- **Pure Primes Detected:** 263
- **Twin Prime Pairs Found:** 9

## 5. Hit Density Analysis (Purity Storm)
The following distribution confirms the "Maximum Contamination Focus" at the 10^15 scale:

| Hits per Coordinate | Frequency (Numbers) | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 Hits | 263 | **Pure Prime** |
| 1-2 Hits | 3,668 | Composite |
| 3-5 Hits | 5,210 | Composite |
| 6-9 Hits | 859 | High Contamination |



## 6. Technical Observations
1. **C (Optimization):** The C implementation leveraged `__uint128_t` for modular arithmetic, achieving the lowest overhead.
2. **Rust (Safety):** Rust provided a near-C performance with guaranteed memory safety, critical for large-scale distributed scans.
3. **Accuracy:** Independent verification via Miller-Rabin Primality Test confirmed %100 precision for all detected coordinates.

## 7. Conclusion
The transition to compiled languages (C/Rust) successfully reduced processing latency by **81.3%**. The results prove that DME is not only theoretically sound but also practically superior for high-performance cryptographic and mathematical applications.
